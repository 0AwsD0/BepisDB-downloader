### If you need to download cards in bulk - or cards from certain tags etc. - This app is for you
I'm creating this application to learn some python and have it as a backup means of batch card download. I have my own browser add-on that I wrote in JS that works just fine, but I'm working on this solution in case my broken add-on cease to work. Also, I will not publish source code of that add-on because it's made just for me - so it's a little bit broken but to the extent I don't bother to fix it. And that's how this projects begins. The plan is to use Selenium and do even more functionality than the current browser add-on can do. Add-on worked by clicking download buttons in order, waiting hard-coded  amount of time until download is finished (to prevent multiple downloads, since the site didn;t like that), then clicking next button to move to the next page and repeated. Now I want to create another solution that allows user to create config files to automate download process even more. Will see where it will take me.
