Are you certain game enjoyer? Do you fell annoyed selecting game (same one) every time on startup of the program?
I'll have solution for you!
The new function I planned will check if config file (txt?) exists to automatically choose game on startup!
It will be able to select the download mode too!
The plan is to even add auto download - you create file with all parameters and don't need to type it into console!
The program will do it for you!

~That's the plan will see when or if I'm gonna implement that or any other functionality mentioned in this file, since for me - the current state is enough.

+ better card download -> checking if card is downloaded if it's not or server went down for a second - retry (i = i), and only then downloading next card (i += 1)
+ if server went down for a second and first card couldn't be downloaded - retry loading page at least 1 time
+ packing app into exe
+ selecting download location

+START AT PAGE - when website goes down or the download is stopped //  also before download check if card exists in download folder to skip already downloaded cards
