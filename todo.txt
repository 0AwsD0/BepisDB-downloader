Are you certain game enjoyer? Do you fell annoyed selecting game (same one) every time on startup of the program?
I'll have solution for you!
The new function I planned will check if config file (txt?) exists to automatically choose game on startup!
It will be able to select the download mode too!
The plan is to even add auto download - you create file with all parameters and don't need to type it into console!
The program will do it for you!

~Thats the plan will see when or if I'm gonna implement that

+ better card download -> checking if card is downloaded, and only then downloading next card
+ packing app into exe
